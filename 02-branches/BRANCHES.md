## Branches

### Two Alternatives

There are if-else and switch-case statements in Java. There is a ternary
if-else operator also.

There are comparison operations, that return true or false: equal to,
not equal to, lesser then, greater then, greater or equal to,
lesser or equal to.

There are logical operations, that combines results of comparison ones: *or*,
*and*, *not*, *exclusive or*. There are non short-circuit variants of *or*
and *and* operations also.

Solve the floating comparison problem:

- Read two floating point numbers.

- Output which number is greater and which is smaller:

      X is greater than Y
      Y is smaller than X

Solve the minimax floating problem:

- Read two floating point number.

- Output the minimum and the maximum numbers:

      The maximum value is X.
      The minimum value is Y.

  Only one comparison operator must be used.

Solve the imperial comparison problem:

- Read two numbers, a distance in kilometers and a distance in foots.

- Output which of the distances is greater. For example:

      The distance in foots is greater.

  One foot equals 0.3048 meters.

Solve the metric comparison problem:

- Read two number, a speed in kilometers per hour and a speed in meters per
  second.

- Output which of the speeds is greater. For example:

      The speed in m/s is greater.

Solve the circle fitting problem:

- Read two number, the square of an equilateral triangle and the square of a
  circle.

- Print the following message if the circle fits inside the triangle:

      It fits.

Solve the integer division problem:

- Read to integer numbers, m and n.

- If m is divided by n with a zero remainder, output the quotient.

- Otherwise, output that m is not divisible by n.

Solve the grand three digits problem:

- Read an three digit integer.

- Output which a digit is greater, the first or the last, e.g.

      The last digit is greater.

Solve the pair sum digit problem:

- Read a four digit integer.

- Output whether the sum of the first digits equals to the sum of the last
  ones. For example, if sums are not equal, output:

      The sum of the first two digits does not equal to the sum of two last.

A pedestrian traffic light is programmed in the following way:

- The green light is on for three minutes after the beginning of every hour.

- Then the red light is on for two minutes.

- Then the greed light is on for three minutes again and so on.

Take attention that the light is switched after the beginning of an hour. It
means that the previous light is on at the beginning of it.

Solve the following traffic light problem:

- Read a floating point number, the number of minutes since the beginning of an
  hour, from the string in the format:

      Clock MINUTES

- Output which signal is lighting at this moment, for example:

      The greed light is on.

Solve the three digit six problem:

- Read a three digit integer.

- Output whether it contains the digit six. For example:

      The number contains the digit 6.


### Optional Alternative

In the if-else statement, only the if-branch is mandatory. The else branches
are optional.

Solve the number difference problem:

- Read two float pointing numbers.

- Output whether the first is greater than the second.

- Output whether the second is greater than the first.

Use two if-else statements without optional branches.

Solve the number minimax problem:

- Read two float pointing numbers.

- Output the greatest and the smallest numbers:

      X is greater than Y.

- Output the smallest and greatest numbers:

      Y is smaller than X.

Use only one if-else statement without optional branches.

Solve the four number maximum problem:

- Read four float pointing numbers.

- Output the value of the greatest of them:

        X is the greatest number.

Solve the absolute number problem:

- Read a float pointing number.

- Output its absolute value.

Do not use standard operations to calculate the absolute value. Use the if
statement without optional branches.

Solve the absolute mean problem:

- Read two float pointing numbers.

- Output the mean of absolute values of them.

Do not use standard operations to calculate the absolute values.

Solve the square root comparison problem:

- Read two integer numbers.

- Output the second number multiplied by 5 if its square root is lesser
  than the first number.

Solve the number in range problem:

- Read three float pointing numbers.

- Output those numbers that belongs to the interval from 1.6 to 3.8, including
  the boundaries.

- If no one of the numbers belongs to this interval, output the message:

      None of the numberts are within the interval.

Solve the integer even problem:

- Read four integer numbers.

- Output the number of even numbers if there is at least one such a number.

- Output that there are no even numbers otherwise.

Solve the integer multiply sum problem.

- Read four integer numbers.

- Output the sum of those numbers that are divisible by three.

  Do not use the for statement.

Solve the integer positive sum problem.

- Read four integer numbers.

- Output the sum of those numbers that are positive.

### Three and More Alternatives

A socker team is given by 3 points if it wins a match, 0 if loses, and 1 if it
is a draw. Solve the socker score problem:

- Read an integer, the number of points scored by a socker team in a match.

- Output the match result as text: win, loss, or draw.

Solve the greatest age problem:

- Read two integers, the ages of Mity an Vasy.

- Output who is older, for example, "Vasy is older than Mity".

- Output "They are the same age" if their ages are equal.

Solve the boxer-lover problem:

- Read a float pointing number, the weight of a boxer-lover in kilograms.

- Output her weight class, lightweight - up to 60 kg, light welterweight - up to
  64 kg, welterweight - up to 69 kg.

Solve the two integer division problem:

- Read two different integer numbers.

- Output which the number is a divisor of an other one.

- Output that no one of numbers is a divisor of the other otherwise.
