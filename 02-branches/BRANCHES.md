### Two Alternatives

There are if-else and switch-case statements in Java. There is a ternary
if-else operator also.

There are comparison operations, that return true or false: equal to,
not equal to, lesser then, greater then, greater or equal to,
lesser or equal to.

There are logical operations, that combines results of comparison ones: *or*,
*and*, *not*, *exclusive or*. There are non short-circuit variants of *or*
and *and* operations also.
