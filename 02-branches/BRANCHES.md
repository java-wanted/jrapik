### Two Alternatives

There are if-else and switch-case statements in Java. There is a ternary
if-else operator also.

There are comparison operations, that return true or false: equal to,
not equal to, lesser then, greater then, greater or equal to,
lesser or equal to.

There are logical operations, that combines results of comparison ones: *or*,
*and*, *not*, *exclusive or*. There are non short-circuit variants of *or*
and *and* operations also.

Solve the floating comparison problem:

- Read two floating point numbers.

- Output which number is greater and which is smaller:

      X is greater than Y
      Y is smaller than X

Solve the minimax floating problem:

- Read two floating point number.

- Output the minimum and the maximum numbers:

      The maximum value is X.
      The minimum value is Y.

  Only one comparison operator must be used.

Solve the imperial comparison problem:

- Read two numbers, a distance in kilometers and a distance in foots.

- Output which of the distances is greater. For example:

      The distance in foots is greater.

  One foot equals 0.3048 meters.

Solve the metric comparison problem:

- Read two number, a speed in kilometers per hour and a speed in meters per
  second.

- Output which of the speeds is greater. For example:

      The speed in m/s is greater.

Solve the circle fitting problem:

- Read two number, the square of an equilateral triangle and the square of a
  circle.

- Print the following message if the circle fits inside the triangle:

      It fits.

Solve the integer division problem:

- Read to integer numbers, m and n.

- If m is divided by n with a zero remainder, output the quotient.

- Otherwise, output that m is not divisible by n.

Solve the grand three digits problem:

- Read an three digit integer.

- Output which a digit is greater, the first or the last, e.g.

      The last digit is greater.

Solve the pair sum digit problem:

- Read a four digit integer.

- Output whether the sum of the first digits equals to the sum of the last
  ones. For example, if sums are not equal, output:

      The sum of the first two digits does not equal to the sum of two last.
